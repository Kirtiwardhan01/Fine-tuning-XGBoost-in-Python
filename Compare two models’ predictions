Compare two modelsâ€™ predictions, where one model uses one more variable than the other model. 
Specifically compare the data where the predictions are different (predicted classes are different)

Remember that in a real life project, if you industrialize an XGBoost model today, tomorrow you will want to improve the model, 
for instance by adding new features to the model or simply new data. 

To compare the two models, plot the probability of belonging to class 1 (risk = proba > 50%)
You will know how your new model compares to the old one, where they are similar and where they are different
Similarly, plot the two feature_importance tables along each other and compare the most relevant features in both model
